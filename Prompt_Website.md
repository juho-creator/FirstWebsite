We have all the necessary files. You need to write an html code with specific functionality and file names. Below is the code for the webpage. The webpage is titled "Juho Kim's Website" and has the following functionality:

The webpage has a background color of #f2f2f2.
The webpage uses the Arial font and has a text alignment of center.
The webpage has a container element with a maximum width of 600px, centered on the page.
The webpage displays an image with the ID "image". The image source is set to "pepe-the-frog-head-pat.gif" and has an alternate text of "Funny Asian Man". The image has a width of 300px and a height that adjusts automatically.
The webpage displays a heading with the text "Juho Kim" using a font size of 32px and a color of #333.
The webpage displays a subheading with the ID "age". The subheading should be empty initially.
The webpage displays two paragraphs. The first paragraph has the text "Passionate Programmer!" and the second paragraph contains a link with the text "Check out my AI-generated podcast!" The link has an href attribute set to "https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/juhooray" and a color of #0066cc with no underline.
The webpage displays a button with the text "Surprise Me!" and the class "button". When the button is clicked, it triggers a JavaScript function called "changeBackgroundColor()".
The webpage includes a script tag that contains JavaScript code for the "changeBackgroundColor()" function. This function toggles the class "crazy-colors" on the body element, changes the image source between "fast-cat-excited.gif" and "banana-cat-crying.gif" based on the state of the "isSurpriseActive" variable, and plays an audio file. The audio file should loop and the source should be chosen from the "audioFiles" array.
The webpage includes a script tag that calculates the age of Juho Kim based on his birthdate (October 8, 2002) and the current date. The calculated age is then inserted into the subheading with the ID "age".
Recreate the webpage exactly as described above, including the same file names and functionality.

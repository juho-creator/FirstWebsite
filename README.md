# FirstWebsite made using Chatgpt
Check out this [website](https://juho-creator.github.io/FirstWebsite/) made by chatgpt!


This is the first website I've created using Chatgpt. The entire website was built via prompt engineering. 
It is amazing how we live in a world where we can program in any language like an expert with a bit of knowledge on programming.


It took me an hour to build the following website because it was my first time creating a website using chatgpt.
But I'm pretty sure it would've taken me less than 5 minutes if I had prior knowledge on html.


I had this [conversation](ConversationHistory.md) with chatgpt to make the website
